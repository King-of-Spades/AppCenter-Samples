# App Center Test samples
These samples are preconstructed to demonstrate how each test framework included can be used along with a demo app in App Center Test.

Primary documentation for App Center Test is available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/

# Upload commands
No matter which test framework you are using, to run UI Tests in App Center, you **must** generate a prototype upload commandline in one of the systems using the wizard. This command line requires modifications in order to be executed, which the test framework-specific upload scripts demonstrate for basic usage. 

1. Log into https://appcenter.ms
2. If you have not already created your app, do so by selecting **Add new > Add new app**. (More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps)
3. Name your app, select the target OS of your app, and the platform your app is written in. 
4. Select the **Test** icon on the left side of the screen, it is a circle with a checkmark inside of it.
5. Click **New test run**
6. Select the devices you wish to run your tests on.
7. Configure the test framework you are using.
8. On the submit screen follow the "prerequesites" step if this is your first time creating a run in AppCenter/Test. 
9. Copy the command from **Running Tests > Upload and schedule tests**. 

#### Example (Your exact command will differ)
> appcenter test run appium --app "kegr/ReadmeDemo" --devices "kegr/top-4" --app-path pathToFile.apk  --test-series "master" --locale "en_US" --build-dir target/upload
